# Compiler-Construction-Quiz-3-Interpreter
## Adding some features to Lox:
- Add the ability to repeat the string the number of times the number multiplied by it as `print 5 * "string";`
- Add comparisons among mixed types, like `3 < "pancake"`
- Add Concatenate String and Number like `"scone" + 4`
- Add support to the REPL to let users type in both statements and expressions. If they enter a statement, execute it. If they enter an expression, evaluate it and display the result value
- Adding the possibility of defining a variable without the word `Var` and allowing the use of a local variable as a global variable
